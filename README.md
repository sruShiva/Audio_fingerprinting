# Audio fingerprinting

Audio fingerprinting is a technique used to uniquely identify and extract a "fingerprint" or signature from an audio signal. This fingerprint is a compact, digital representation of the audio content that can be used for tasks such as identifying songs, matching audio clips, or detecting similarities between different audio files.

The process involves analyzing key features of the audio, such as frequency, amplitude, and time-domain characteristics, and converting them into a robust and distinctive identifier that is resistant to noise, distortion, or slight variations in the audio. Once the fingerprint is created, it can be stored in a database or compared against other fingerprints for tasks like audio recognition, copyright detection, or music recommendation systems.

This project analyses two different tunes and checks the similarity between the tunes using Jaccard similarity. This technique is used in applications like music recognition apps (e.g., Shazam) or Spotify to recommend the next best similar tune
